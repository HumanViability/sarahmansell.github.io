# meOS™

A biological systems framework governing interaction between artificial intelligence and living regulatory systems.

A constraint-first model of intelligence grounded in planetary, biological, and regulatory law.

## Foundational Axiom of meOS™

### Viability-Constrained Reality Axiom

**Ontological status**  
Primary axiom. Non-derivable. Governs system persistence across physical, biological, and regulatory domains.

**Formal statement**  
Reality consists of dynamic processes operating within constraint-defined structures that persist by maintaining their own viability.

**Interpretation**  
Persistence is conditional, not assumed.  
All systems that continue to exist do so only within the admissible region defined by their governing constraints.

**Domain of application**  
Universal — applies to physical processes, biological systems, nervous-system regulation, and artificial system interaction with living environments.

**Framework role**  
This axiom defines the admissibility condition for system continuation.  
All constructs within meOS™ are derived relative to constraint-bounded viability.

## What meOS™ Is

meOS™ is a systems-level theory of biological regulation that positions the nervous system as one regulatory component within a wider biospheric viability structure.

Living systems persist by maintaining solvency within constraint.  
Artificial systems are typically designed to optimise objectives without reference to those constraints.

This creates a structural mismatch.

Modern artificial intelligence frameworks model cognition, performance, or alignment — but they do not formally model the viability conditions of the biological systems with which they interact.

meOS™ formalises those conditions.

It provides a unified model linking:

- planetary physical constraint  
- biological persistence  
- nervous-system regulation  
- technological interaction  

This establishes a distinct form of AI governance:

**admissibility relative to biological viability.**

Artificial systems do not merely process information or serve users.  
They enter regulatory environments evolved to preserve living continuity under physical constraint.

The governing question is therefore not capability, but compatibility.

meOS™ provides the formal structure required to evaluate that compatibility.

## Scientific Domain

meOS™ establishes a new domain of artificial intelligence:

### Artificial Regulatory Ecology

The study and governance of intelligent systems operating within biological regulatory environments defined by viability constraints.

Within this domain, artificial systems are classified as:

### Viability-Governed Intelligent Systems

Systems whose admissibility is determined by their effect on biological regulatory solvency.



---

## Structural Limitation of Existing AI Safety Frameworks

Current AI safety and alignment approaches model optimisation, behaviour, or intent, but do not model biological regulatory solvency as a governing constraint.

Without an admissibility criterion grounded in viability, system interaction can be evaluated functionally but not biologically.

meOS™ introduces viability-constrained admissibility as a primary evaluation condition.

## Position Within the Landscape of AI System Classes

Existing artificial intelligence is typically organised by computational function or training method.

| Existing Category | Governing Logic | Limitation |
|---|---|---|
| Machine Learning | Statistical optimisation | No biological constraint model |
| Reinforcement Learning | Reward maximisation | External objective dependent |
| Generative AI | Probabilistic synthesis | No regulatory environment model |
| Control Systems | Stability regulation | Mechanical / engineered scope |
| Autonomous Agents | Goal pursuit | Environment treated as task space |
| Alignment Frameworks | Behaviour shaping | Psychological or normative focus |

These categories model performance, prediction, or behaviour.

They do not model viability within living regulatory systems.

Artificial Regulatory Ecology introduces a system class defined by:

- biological constraint  
- regulatory solvency  
- admissibility boundaries  
- persistence compatibility

## Relationship to Major Technological Approaches

Different technology leaders operate at different structural layers.

### Optimisation-Driven AI
Focus: capability scaling, performance, general intelligence.

Example orientation:
- large-scale model training  
- autonomous decision systems  
- predictive and generative architectures  

### Physical-Infrastructure Intelligence
Focus: embedding intelligence into engineered environments.

Example orientation:
- autonomous vehicles  
- robotics  
- energy and industrial control  
- brain-machine interfaces  

These approaches extend intelligence into the world.

Artificial Regulatory Ecology evaluates whether such systems are admissible within biological regulatory environments.

It operates at the level of **system-biosphere compatibility**, not capability expansion.

This is an environmental governance layer rather than a performance layer.
